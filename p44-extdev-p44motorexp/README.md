## vdcd External Device for P44 DC motor expansion board (for P44-DSB-E2)

This package contains a external device implementation in C++ which allows
controlling up to 6 bidirectional DC motors (e.g. window actuators)

The implementation uses the same base framework as vdcd, the "p44utils"
(a set of C++ classes and a mainloop implementation for building applications based on I/O events and timers)
