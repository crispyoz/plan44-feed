This package contains a external device implementation in C++ which allows connecting a Elsner P03 or P04 Weather station via serial port.

The implementation uses the same base framework as vdcd, the "p44utils" (a set of C++ classes and a mainloop implementation for building applications based on I/O events and timers)
